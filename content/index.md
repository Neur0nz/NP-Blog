This is a blog created by me (Nadav Perry) to write about things I'm interested in, mostly mathematics and computer science. additionally most posts will probably be written in Hebrew however I did separate the posts into Hebrew and English posts so even if you don't speak Hebrew, feel free to look around ðŸ¤©.
